    db_manager.initialize_default_projects()
    db_manager.initialize_default_settings()
    yield db_manager
    db_manager.cleanup()

### Test Markers and Categories

#### Pytest Markers
```python
# pytest.ini
[tool:pytest]
markers =
    unit: Unit tests (Tier 1) - fast, isolated component testing
    integration: Integration tests (Tier 2) - cross-component validation
    feature: Feature tests (Tier 3) - end-to-end user scenarios
    concurrency: Concurrency tests (Tier 4) - multi-app database stress
    system: System tests (Tier 5) - comprehensive release validation
    gui: Tests requiring PySide6 GUI components
    audio: Tests requiring audio hardware or pygame
    network: Tests requiring network connectivity or Google Drive API
    slow: Tests taking more than 10 seconds
    database: Tests requiring database operations
    cross_platform: Tests that must pass on all supported platforms
```

#### Execution Examples
```bash
# Run only fast tests
pytest -m "unit and not slow"

# Run tests suitable for CI (no GUI/audio)
pytest -m "not gui and not audio"

# Run database concurrency tests specifically
pytest -m "concurrency and database" -v

# Cross-platform compatibility tests
pytest -m "cross_platform" --tb=short

# Performance-sensitive tests
pytest -m "slow" --durations=10
```

### Performance Benchmarks and SLA

#### Execution Time Service Level Agreements
- **Tier 1 (Unit)**: Must complete in <30 seconds, target <15 seconds
- **Tier 2 (Integration)**: Must complete in <5 minutes, target <3 minutes
- **Tier 3 (Feature)**: Must complete in <30 minutes, target <20 minutes
- **Tier 4 (Concurrency)**: Must complete in <40 minutes, target <30 minutes
- **Tier 5 (System)**: Must complete in <75 minutes, target <60 minutes

#### Functional Performance Targets
- **Timer Accuracy**: ±100ms deviation over 25-minute sprint
- **Database Operations**: <50ms for typical CRUD operations
- **Google Drive Sync**: <60s for database merge with <1000 sprints
- **Audio Latency**: <200ms from timer completion to alarm start
- **GUI Responsiveness**: <16ms for UI state updates (60fps)
- **Export Performance**: <5s for Excel export of 1000 sprints
- **Memory Usage**: <100MB steady state, <200MB during sync operations

### Risk Mitigation and Test Quality

#### Test Environment Isolation
- **Database Isolation**: Every test uses fresh in-memory or temporary file databases - ZERO impact on production
- **Settings Isolation**: Temporary configuration files per test in /tmp directories
- **File System Isolation**: All tests operate in temporary directories, auto-cleaned
- **Network Mocking**: Google Drive API mocked for most tests - no real API calls
- **Audio Mocking**: Audio hardware dependencies eliminated in CI environments

#### Flaky Test Prevention
- **Deterministic Timing**: No sleep() calls, use proper synchronization
- **Thread Safety**: All multi-threaded operations properly synchronized
- **Resource Cleanup**: Fixtures ensure complete cleanup after tests
- **Idempotent Operations**: Tests can be run multiple times safely
- **Platform Independence**: Tests avoid platform-specific assumptions

#### Coverage and Quality Metrics
- **Line Coverage**: Minimum 90% for core business logic
- **Branch Coverage**: Minimum 85% for conditional logic
- **Function Coverage**: Minimum 95% for public APIs
- **Integration Coverage**: All user workflows tested end-to-end
- **Error Path Coverage**: All exception handling paths validated

This comprehensive test plan ensures the Pomodora application maintains high reliability across all its complex features while providing rapid feedback to developers and thorough validation for production releases.
